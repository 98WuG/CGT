# Canada Goose Token

The newest revolution in blockchain technology using the Ethereum blockchain protocol. By running on top of the Ethereum blockchain, we offer a decentralized approach to flaunting one's Canada Goose using a virtual cryptocurrency, Canada Goose Token (CGT).

CGT is an anonymous, decentralized, peer-verified ERC20 token. Our final goal is to achieve a 1:1 ratio of 1 CGT to 1 physical Canada Goose jacket.

The ICO will begin on the start of Brown University's  Spring 2018 semester - January 24, 2018. The ICO price will be `1 ETH = 1,000,000 CGT`.
