## What is Canada Goose Token (CGT)?
The newest revolution in blockchain technology using the Ethereum blockchain protocol. By running on top of the Ethereum blockchain, we offer a decentralized approach to flaunting one's Canada Goose wealth using a virtual cryptocurrency, Canada Goose Token (CGT).

CGT is an anonymous, decentralized, peer-verified, tamper-proof ERC20 token. Our final goal is to achieve a 1:1 ratio of 1 CGT to 1 physical Canada Goose jacket.

## How can I obtain CGT?
The ICO will begin on the start of Brown University's  Spring 2018 semester - January 24, 2018. The ICO price will be `1 ETH = 10,000 CGT`. More information will be released as the ICO date approaches.

After the ICO, users may still "mine" CGT through a cookie-clicker like webapp, in which the user's computer hardware is utilized to mine ETH. This ETH is transferred to the ERC20 smart contract address, where the equivalent CGT is then sent to the user's wallet.

## Disclaimer
I know this post will be controversial, but I don't care because I am hurting and need to speak out. I love my Canada Goose and shaming people for wearing canada goose is bullying. Being a decent human being (not worthy of receiving hatred) and wearing expensive outerwear are not mutually exclusive. I, for instance, received one for Christmas my freshman year. I had not asked for it, nor did I know its price. My parents had seen that the temperature in Providence had gone down to -20 degrees celsius and because we come from a warm climate and I get cold easily/sick often, it was very important to them that I stay warm, so they went ahead and bought me what they had heard was a coat warm enough for arctic expeditions. When I realized the cost, I questioned their purchase, but my mother reasoned with me that what canada goose sells is not the label (like big designer brands) but value (plus it has a lifetime warrantee). I'm conscious of how lucky and blessed I am to have parents willing to spend $700 to keep me warm. Yes, there might be some people out there who use the coats for conspicuous consumption (and that is inconsiderate and a bad trait, but honestly they have the right to use their money as they see fit), but I am also certain that there are other students like me for whom this item is merely functional- who only wear it when it's freezing cold outside and for whom this is the most expensive item they have ever owned. So please don't put everybody in the same box. Don't condemn me and make me feel guilty for something I wear. I'm well aware I come from more privilege than most, but that is not something within my control and I always try not isolate lower income people, help when possible and not misuse my parent's money. Fearing judgement and wanting to hide my face whenever I walk out of the house wearing my winter jacket is unnecessary stress.
